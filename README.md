# Credit Card Behaviour Score Prediction
## OBJECTIVE
The project will focus on improving the credit risk management framework of a bank by
developing a forward looking Behaviour Score, that is, a classification model that predicts
whether a credit card customer will default in the following month.Based on the historical
behavioral data of over 30000 customers a binary classification model has to be set up which
helps to predict whether a customer will default in the next billing cycle. Such a model would
allow the bank to flag potential defaulters in advance, allowing the bank to adjust the credit
exposure, trigger early warnings systems and prioritize risk based actions
